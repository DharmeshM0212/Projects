"# Fire Vital: Seamless Real-Time Firefighter Health Monitoring" 


**Description**:  
Fire Vital is an innovative system designed for real-time health monitoring and command center collaboration, specifically tailored for firefighters. This project leverages advanced sensor technology and robust communication protocols to enhance safety and decision-making during critical missions.

**Key Features**:
- Tracks vital signs such as heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and temperature using the MAX30102 sensor.
- Employs a piezoelectric generator for sustainable energy harvesting.
- Uses LoRaWAN and MQTT protocols for long-range, low-power communication.
- Integrates data into a user-friendly web interface for real-time visualization and analysis.
- Facilitates decision-making with live health metrics accessible to commanders and medical personnel.
